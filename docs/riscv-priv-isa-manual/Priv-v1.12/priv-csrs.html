<h1 id="chap:priv-csrs"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Control and Status Registers (CSRs)</h1>
<p>The SYSTEM major opcode is used to encode all privileged instructions
in the RISC-V ISA.
These can be divided into two main classes: those that atomically
read-modify-write control and status registers (CSRs), which are defined in
the Zicsr extension, and all other privileged instructions.
The privileged architecture requires the Zicsr extension; which other
privileged instructions are required depends on the privileged-architecture
feature set.</p>
<p>In addition to the unprivileged
state described in Volume I of this manual, an implementation may
contain additional CSRs, accessible by some subset of the privilege
levels using the CSR instructions described in Volume I.
In this chapter, we map out the CSR address space. The following
chapters describe the function of each of the CSRs according to
privilege level, as well as the other privileged instructions which
are generally closely associated with a particular privilege level.
Note that although CSRs and instructions are associated with one
privilege level, they are also accessible at all higher privilege
levels.</p>
<p>Standard CSRs do not have side effects on reads but may have side effects
on writes.</p>
<h2 id="csr-address-mapping-conventions"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> CSR Address Mapping Conventions</h2>
<p>The standard RISC-V ISA sets aside a 12-bit encoding space (csr[11:0])
for up to 4,096 CSRs. By convention, the upper 4 bits of the CSR
address (csr[11:8]) are used to encode the read and write
accessibility of the CSRs according to privilege level as shown in
Table <a href="priv-csrs.html#csrrwpriv" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="csrrwpriv">1.1</a>. The top two bits (csr[11:10]) indicate whether
the register is read/write (<span>00</span>, <span>01</span>, or <span>10</span>) or
read-only (<span>11</span>). The next two bits (csr[9:8]) encode the lowest
privilege level that can access the CSR.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>The CSR address convention uses the upper bits of the CSR address to
encode default access privileges. This simplifies error checking in
the hardware and provides a larger CSR space, but does constrain the
mapping of CSRs into the address space.</p>
<p>Implementations might allow a more-privileged level to trap otherwise
permitted CSR accesses by a less-privileged level to allow these
accesses to be intercepted. This change should be transparent to the
less-privileged software.</p>

</figure>
<p>Attempts to access a non-existent CSR raise an illegal instruction
exception. Attempts to access a CSR without appropriate privilege
level or to write a read-only register also raise illegal instruction
exceptions. A read/write register might also contain some bits that
are read-only, in which case writes to the read-only bits are ignored.</p>
<p>Table <a href="priv-csrs.html#csrrwpriv" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="csrrwpriv">1.1</a> also indicates the convention to allocate CSR
addresses between standard and custom uses. The CSR addresses
designated for custom uses will not be redefined by future
standard extensions.</p>
<p>Machine-mode standard read-write CSRs <span>0x7A0</span>–<span>0x7BF</span> are reserved
for use by the debug system. Of these CSRs, <span>0x7A0</span>–<span>0x7AF</span> are
accessible to machine mode, whereas <span>0x7B0</span>–<span>0x7BF</span> are only visible
to debug mode. Implementations should raise illegal instruction exceptions on
machine-mode access to the latter set of registers.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>Effective virtualization requires that as many instructions run natively as
possible inside a virtualized environment, while any privileged accesses trap
to the virtual machine monitor <span class="citation" data-cites="goldbergvm"><a href="#ref-goldbergvm">[goldbergvm]</a></span>. CSRs that are read-only at
some lower privilege level are shadowed into separate CSR addresses if they
are made read-write at a higher privilege level. This avoids trapping
permitted lower-privilege accesses while still causing traps on illegal
accesses. Currently, the counters are the only shadowed CSRs.</p>

currently been allocated CSR addresses. The timers, counters, and
floating-point CSRs are standard unprivileged CSRs.
The other
registers are used by privileged code, as described in the following
chapters. Note that not all registers are required on all
implementations.</p>

<h2 id="csr-field-specifications"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> CSR Field Specifications</h2>
<p>The following definitions and abbreviations are used in specifying the
behavior of fields within the CSRs.</p>
<h3 id="reserved-writes-preserve-values-reads-ignore-values-wpri" class="unnumbered">Reserved Writes Preserve Values, Reads Ignore Values (WPRI)</h3>
<p>Some whole read/write fields are reserved for future use. Software
should ignore the values read from these fields, and should preserve
the values held in these fields when writing values to other fields of
the same register.
For forward compatibility, implementations that do not furnish these fields
must make them read-only zero.
These fields are labeled <strong>WPRI</strong> in the register descriptions.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>To simplify the software model, any backward-compatible future
definition of previously reserved fields within a CSR must cope with
the possibility that a non-atomic read/modify/write sequence is used
to update other fields in the CSR. Alternatively, the original CSR
definition must specify that subfields can only be updated atomically,
which may require a two-instruction clear bit/set bit sequence in
general that can be problematic if intermediate values are not legal.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="writeread-only-legal-values-wlrl" class="unnumbered">Write/Read Only Legal Values (WLRL)</h3>
<p>Some read/write CSR fields specify behavior for only a subset of
possible bit encodings, with other bit encodings reserved. Software
should not write anything other than legal values to such a field, and
should not assume a read will return a legal value unless the last
write was of a legal value, or the register has not been written since
another operation (e.g., reset) set the register to a legal value.
These fields are labeled <strong>WLRL</strong> in the register descriptions.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>Hardware implementations need only implement enough state bits to
differentiate between the supported values, but must always return the
complete specified bit-encoding of any supported value when read.</p>
</div>
<p>Implementations are permitted but not required to raise an illegal
instruction exception if an instruction attempts to write a
non-supported value to a <strong>WLRL</strong> field. Implementations can
return arbitrary bit patterns on the read of a <strong>WLRL</strong> field when the last
write was of an illegal value, but the value returned should
deterministically depend on the illegal written value and
the value of the field prior to the write.</p>
<h3 id="write-any-values-reads-legal-values-warl" class="unnumbered">Write Any Values, Reads Legal Values (WARL)</h3>
<p>Some read/write CSR fields are only defined for a subset of bit
encodings, but allow any value to be written while guaranteeing to
return a legal value whenever read. Assuming that writing the CSR has
no other side effects, the range of supported values can be determined
by attempting to write a desired setting then reading to see if the
value was retained. These fields are labeled <strong>WARL</strong> in the register
descriptions.</p>
<p>Implementations will not raise an exception on writes of unsupported
values to a <strong>WARL</strong> field. Implementations can
return any legal value on the read of a <strong>WARL</strong> field when the last
write was of an illegal value, but the legal value returned should
deterministically depend on the illegal written value and
the architectural state of the hart.</p>
<h2 id="csr-field-modulation"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> CSR Field Modulation</h2>
<p>If a write to one CSR changes the set of legal values allowed for a
field of a second CSR, then unless specified otherwise, the second
CSR’s field immediately gets an  value from among its new
legal values.
This is true even if the field’s value before the write remains legal
after the write;
the value of the field may be changed in consequence of the write to
the controlling CSR.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>As a special case of this rule, the value written to one CSR may
control whether a field of a second CSR is writable (with multiple
legal values) or is read-only.
When a write to the controlling CSR causes the second CSR’s field
to change from previously read-only to now writable, that field
immediately gets an  but legal value, unless specified
otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div class=commentary>
<p>Some CSR fields are, when writable, defined as aliases of other CSR
fields.
Let <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> be such a CSR field, and let <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> be the CSR field it aliases
when writable.
If a write to a controlling CSR causes field <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> to change from
previously read-only to now writable, the new value of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is not
 but instead immediately reflects the existing value of its
alias <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, as required.</p>
</div>
<p>A change to the value of a CSR for this reason is not a write to the
affected CSR and thus does not trigger any side effects specified for
that CSR.</p>
<h2 id="implicit-reads-of-csrs"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Implicit Reads of CSRs</h2>
<p>Implementations sometimes perform <span><em>implicit</em></span> reads of CSRs.
(For example, all S-mode instruction fetches implicitly read the <span>satp</span>
CSR.)
Unless otherwise specified, the value returned by an implicit read of a CSR
is the same value that would have been returned by an explicit read of the
CSR, using a CSR-access instruction in a sufficient privilege mode.</p>
<h2 id="sec:csrwidthmodulation"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> CSR Width Modulation</h2>
<p>If the width of a CSR is changed (for example, by changing MXLEN or UXLEN, as
described in Section <a href="machine.html#xlen-control" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="xlen-control">[xlen-control]</a>), the values of the <span><em>writable</em></span>
fields and bits of the new-width CSR are, unless specified otherwise,
determined from the previous-width CSR as though by this algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The value of the previous-width CSR is copied to a temporary register of
the same width.</p></li>
<li><p>For the read-only bits of the previous-width CSR, the bits at the same
positions in the temporary register are set to zeros.</p></li>
<li><p>The width of the temporary register is changed to the new width. If the
new width <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> is narrower than the previous width, the least-significant <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>
bits of the temporary register are retained and the more-significant bits are
discarded. If the new width is wider than the previous width, the temporary
register is zero-extended to the wider width.</p></li>
<li><p>Each writable field of the new-width CSR takes the value of the bits at
the same positions in the temporary register.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Changing the width of a CSR is not a read or write of the CSR and thus
does not trigger any side effects.</p>
