<h1 data-number="11"><span class="header-section-number">11</span> “Zicntr” and “Zihpm” Counters</h1>
<p>RISC-V ISAs provide a set of up to thirty-two 64-bit performance counters and
timers that are accessible via unprivileged XLEN-bit read-only CSR
registers <span><code>0xC00</code></span>–<span><code>0xC1F</code></span> (when XLEN=32, the upper 32 bits
are accessed via CSR registers <span><code>0xC80</code></span>–<span><code>0xC9F</code></span>).
These counters are divided between the “Zicntr” and “Zihpm” extensions.</p>
<section id="zicntr-standard-extension-for-base-counters-and-timers" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="11.1"><span class="header-section-number">11.1</span> “Zicntr” Standard Extension for Base Counters and Timers</h2>
<p>The Zicntr standard extension comprises the first three of these
counters (CYCLE, TIME, and INSTRET), which
have dedicated functions (cycle
count, real-time clock, and instructions retired, respectively).
The Zicntr extension depends on the Zicsr extension.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>We recommend provision of these basic counters in implementations as
they are essential for basic performance analysis, adaptive and
dynamic optimization, and to allow an application to work with
real-time streams. Additional counters in the separate Zihpm extension can
help diagnose performance problems and these should be made accessible
from user-level application code with low overhead.</p>
<p>Some execution environments might prohibit access to counters, for
example, to impede timing side-channel attacks.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="counters_00.svg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>For base ISAs with XLEN<span class="math inline">≥</span>64, CSR instructions can access the full
64-bit CSRs directly. In particular, the RDCYCLE, RDTIME, and
RDINSTRET pseudoinstructions read the full 64 bits of the <span><code>cycle</code></span>,
<span><code>time</code></span>, and <span><code>instret</code></span> counters.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>The counter pseudoinstructions are mapped to the read-only <span><code>csrrs rd, counter, x0</code></span> canonical form, but the other read-only CSR
instruction forms (based on CSRRC/CSRRSI/CSRRCI) are also legal ways
to read these CSRs.</p>
</div>
<p>For base ISAs with XLEN=32, the Zicntr extension enables the three
64-bit read-only counters to be accessed in 32-bit pieces.
The RDCYCLE, RDTIME, and RDINSTRET pseudoinstructions provide the lower 32
bits, and the RDCYCLEH, RDTIMEH, and RDINSTRETH pseudoinstructions provide
the upper 32 bits of the respective counters.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>We required the counters be 64 bits wide, even when XLEN=32, as otherwise
it is very difficult for software to determine if values have
overflowed. For a low-end implementation, the upper 32 bits of each
counter can be implemented using software counters incremented by a
trap handler triggered by overflow of the lower 32 bits. The sample
code given below shows how the full 64-bit width value can be
safely read using the individual 32-bit width pseudoinstructions.</p>
</div>
<p>The RDCYCLE pseudoinstruction reads the low XLEN bits of the <span><code> cycle</code></span> CSR which holds a count of the number of clock cycles
executed by the processor core on which the hart is running from an
arbitrary start time in the past. RDCYCLEH is only present when
XLEN=32 and reads bits 63–32 of the same cycle
counter. The underlying 64-bit counter should never overflow in
practice. The rate at which the cycle counter advances will depend on
the implementation and operating environment. The execution
environment should provide a means to determine the current rate
(cycles/second) at which the cycle counter is incrementing.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>RDCYCLE is intended to return the number of cycles executed by the
processor core, not the hart. Precisely defining what is a “core” is
difficult given some implementation choices (e.g., AMD Bulldozer).
Precisely defining what is a “clock cycle” is also difficult given the
range of implementations (including software emulations), but the
intent is that RDCYCLE is used for performance monitoring along with the
other performance counters. In particular, where there is one
hart/core, one would expect cycle-count/instructions-retired to
measure CPI for a hart.</p>
<p>Cores don’t have to be exposed to software at all, and an implementor
might choose to pretend multiple harts on one physical core are
running on separate cores with one hart/core, and provide separate
cycle counters for each hart. This might make sense in a simple
barrel processor (e.g., CDC 6600 peripheral processors) where
inter-hart timing interactions are non-existent or minimal.</p>
<p>Where there is more than one hart/core and dynamic multithreading, it
is not generally possible to separate out cycles per hart (especially
with SMT). It might be possible to define a separate performance
counter that tried to capture the number of cycles a particular hart
was running, but this definition would have to be very fuzzy to cover
all the possible threading implementations. For example, should we
only count cycles for which any instruction was issued to execution
for this hart, and/or cycles any instruction retired, or include
cycles this hart was occupying machine resources but couldn’t execute
due to stalls while other harts went into execution? Likely, “all of
the above” would be needed to have understandable performance stats.
This complexity of defining a per-hart cycle count, and also the need
in any case for a total per-core cycle count when tuning multithreaded
code led to just standardizing the per-core cycle counter, which also
happens to work well for the common single hart/core case.</p>
<p>Standardizing what happens during “sleep” is not practical given
that what “sleep” means is not standardized across execution
environments, but if the entire core is paused (entirely clock-gated
or powered-down in deep sleep), then it is not executing clock cycles,
and the cycle count shouldn’t be increasing per the spec. There are
many details, e.g., whether clock cycles required to reset a processor
after waking up from a power-down event should be counted, and these
are considered execution-environment-specific details.</p>
<p>Even though there is no precise definition that works for all
platforms, this is still a useful facility for most platforms, and an
imprecise, common, “usually correct” standard here is better than no
standard. The intent of RDCYCLE was primarily performance
monitoring/tuning, and the specification was written with that goal in
mind.</p>
</div>
<p>The RDTIME pseudoinstruction reads the low XLEN bits of the <span><code> time</code></span> CSR, which counts wall-clock real time that has passed from an
arbitrary start time in the past.
RDTIMEH is only present when XLEN=32 and reads bits 63–32 of the same
real-time counter.
The underlying 64-bit counter increments by one with each tick of the
real-time clock, and, for realistic real-time clock frequencies, should never
overflow in practice.
The execution environment should provide a means of determining the period of
a counter tick (seconds/tick).
The period should be constant within a small error bound.
The environment should provide a means to determine the accuracy of the clock
(i.e., the maximum relative error between the nominal and actual real-time
clock periods).</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>On some simple platforms, cycle count might represent a valid
implementation of RDTIME, in which case RDTIME and RDCYCLE may
return the same result.</p>
<p>It is difficult to provide a strict mandate on clock period given the
wide variety of possible implementation platforms. The maximum error
bound should be set based on the requirements of the platform.</p>
</div>
<p>The real-time clocks of all harts
must be synchronized to within one tick of the real-time clock.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>As with other architectural mandates, it suffices to appear “as if”
harts are synchronized to within one tick of the real-time clock,
i.e., software is unable to observe that there is a greater delta
between the real-time clock values observed on two harts.</p>
</div>
<p>The RDINSTRET pseudoinstruction reads the low XLEN bits of the <span><code> instret</code></span> CSR, which counts the number of instructions retired by
this hart from some arbitrary start point in the past. RDINSTRETH is
only present when XLEN=32 and reads bits 63–32 of the same
instruction counter. The underlying 64-bit counter should never
overflow in practice.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>Instructions that cause synchronous exceptions, including ECALL and EBREAK,
are not considered to retire and hence do not increment the <span><code>instret</code></span> CSR.</p>
</div>
<p>The following code sequence will read a valid 64-bit cycle counter value into
<span><code>x3</code></span>:<span><code>x2</code></span>, even if the counter overflows its lower half between reading its upper
and lower halves.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.2"><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> “Zihpm” Standard Extension for Hardware Performance Counters</h2>
<p>The Zihpm extension comprises up to 29 additional unprivileged 64-bit
hardware performance counters, <span><code>hpmcounter3</code></span>–<span><code>hpmcounter31</code></span>.
When XLEN=32, the upper 32 bits of these performance counters are
accessible via additional CSRs <span><code>hpmcounter3h</code></span>–<span><code> hpmcounter31h</code></span>. The Zihpm extension depends on the Zicsr extension.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>In some applications, it is important to be able to read multiple
counters at the same instant in time. When run under a multitasking
environment, a user thread can suffer a context switch while
attempting to read the counters. One solution is for the user thread
to read the real-time counter before and after reading the other
counters to determine if a context switch occurred in the middle of the
sequence, in which case the reads can be retried. We considered
adding output latches to allow a user thread to snapshot the counter
values atomically, but this would increase the size of the user
context, especially for implementations with a richer set of counters.</p>
</div>
<p>The implemented number and width of these additional counters, and the
set of events they count, is platform-specific. Accessing an
unimplemented or ill-configured counter may cause an illegal
instruction exception or may return a constant value.</p>
<p>The execution environment should provide a means to determine the
number and width of the implemented counters, and an interface to
configure the events to be counted by each counter.</p>
<div class=commentary>
<p>For execution environments implemented on RISC-V privileged
platforms, the privileged architecture manual describes privileged
CSRs controlling access by lower privileged modes to these counters,
and to set the events to be counted.</p>
<p>Alternative execution environments (e.g., user-level-only software
performance models) may provide alternative mechanisms to configure
the events counted by the performance counters.</p>
<p>It would be useful to eventually standardize event settings to count
ISA-level metrics, such as the number of floating-point instructions
executed for example, and possibly a few common microarchitectural
metrics, such as “L1 instruction cache misses”.</p>
